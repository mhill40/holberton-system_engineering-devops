i have a massively better understanding of git, gh, working with repos, commiting, and the arguements.
I feel SO SO SO much better about the fundamentals and now have a solid foundation
in which i can now build upon. Please lets find a way to keep me in this cohort,
i feel at home with this set of peers.
